I am a Ph.D. student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), advised by [Prof. Elisa Bertino](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/bertino/). My research focuses on **protocol security** and **formal verification**.

I am also a **Founding Engineer** at [Eigen AI](https://eigen.ai/), where I work on LLM infrastructure, including serving optimization, CUDA kernel development, and production deployment.

Previously, I received my B.E. from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2022.
