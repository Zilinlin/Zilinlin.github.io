  - ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) 2024
  - Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) 2024
* **Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) member:**
  - Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC), 2024

## Technical Skills
* **Programming Languages:** Python, C, C++

## Research Experience
* **Wi-Fi protocols implementation fuzzing**  
  - Purdue University (September 2024 - Present)  
    - In this project, I use protocol fuzzing to check the security of Wi-Fi protocol implementation.

* **Wi-Fi for IoT protocols Verification**  
  - Purdue University (September 2023 - May 2024)  
    - I work on the protocols designed by Wi-Fi Alliance for IoT (Internet of Things) usage, which include Wi-Fi Direct, Wi-Fi EasyMesh, Wi-Fi EasyConnect, and Wi-Fi Aware.  
    - I use the formal verification tool Tamarin to verify the secrecy, authentication, and privacy properties of the protocols. During the formal verification process, I designed a methodology for decomposition and compositional reasoning to address the scalability problem - this methodology is the first ever proposed.  
    - By using Tamarin and my methodology, I identified several new authentication bypass and privacy leakage attacks, which are acknowledged by Wi-Fi Alliance.

* **DNSSEC Formal Verification**  
  - Purdue University in collaboration with the University of California, Irvine (UCI) (February 2024 - Present)  
    - In this project, in collaboration with a student from UCI, I use Tamarin to formally verify the security of DNSSEC, which is an important security mechanism in DNS.

* **Wi-Fi Fragmentation and PSM Verification**  
  - Purdue University (April 2023 - August 2023)  
    - In this project, I carried out an extensive formal analysis of the functional aspects of the Wi-Fi protocol, more specifically, the fragmentation and the power-save-mode process.  
    - During this process, I designed a novel segment-based formal verification process and introduced a practical threat model (i.e., MAC spoofing) in Tamarin to reason about the various capabilities of the attacker.  
    - To this end, I verified 3 known attacks and discovered 2 new issues. These vulnerabilities and issues were tested on 17 commercial devices.
